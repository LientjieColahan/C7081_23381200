## Background

Obesity is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater. The World Obesity Federation's Obesity Atlas (2025) projects 1.13 billion people will be living with obesity globally by 2030, and currently 28% of UK adults are living with obesity. Obesity carries significant economic and psychological costs, with a recent review by Nagi et al. (2024) estimating annual costs between 15 million and 126 billion US dollars, measured as as United States (US) dollar purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2022, depending on the country. Globally, the economic burden can reach up to 2.47% of total GDP. Beyond financial impact, obesity is associated with intangible costs including personal suffering and social stigma.

The research has found the causes of obesity to be multi pronged and inter-related but it is possible to simplify it to a set of non-modifiable and modifiable factors (Masood et al., 2023). The non-modifiable factors involve genetic mutations, polymorphisms and changes in gene expression which predispose individuals to obesity and can not be avoided. The modifiable factors include the epigenetic factors coming from an obesogenic environment making a person more prone to becoming obese, level of physical activity, insufficient sleep, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, psychosocial stress, the gastrointestinal microbiome and others.

In order for policy makers to get to grips with the obesity pandemic an understanding of the factors that lead to the development of obesity is key. Various computational approaches allow insight into the interplay of factors that lead to obesity (Cervantes et al., 2020; Ferdowsy et al., 2021; Gerl et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2025).

This project aims to fit obesity data to three models with 'Obesity level' (NObeyesdad) as the target variable and all other variables as predictor variables to determine which model performs best. Modelling algorithms have shown promising results in previous studies, with decision trees achieving accuracy rates up to 97.4% (De-La-Hoz-Correa, et al., 2019).

The World Obesity Federation has created a Global Obesity Observatory where you can view the most up to date obesity rates around the world:
